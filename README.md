# üî¨ LLM in Detection Engineering 
# LLM in Detection Engineering ‚Äì Jaravis Agent

## üîé Short Working Brief

**Jaravis Agent** is an AI-powered system designed to revolutionize **Detection Engineering** by automating the generation of high-quality detection rules across multiple cybersecurity platforms.

## Multi Agent - LangGraph Agent

- **Ingestion**: Pulls and normalizes threat intelligence reports directly from **AlienVault OTX**.
- **Mapping**: Correlates ingested threat intelligence with **MITRE ATT&CK** techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs).
- **Rule Generation**: Automatically generates detection rules tailored for diverse cyber defense platforms (e.g., SIEMs, EDRs, IDS/IPS).
- **Repository Management**: Stores and organizes generated rules in a structured repository for rapid deployment and version control.

The goal is to **reduce manual detection engineering efforts by 80%**, enabling faster, more accurate, and consistent threat detection across enterprise security ecosystems.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

Follow the steps below to set up **Jaravis Agent** locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jaravis-ai/LLMDetectionEngineering.git
   cd LLMDetectionEngineering

2. **Install Poetry (if not already installed)**
   ```bash
   pip install poetry

3. **Install Dependencies from pyproject.toml**
   ```bash
   poetry install

This will:
- Create a virtual environment
- Install all dependencies specified in `pyproject.toml`

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env

## üöÄ Running the Project

After completing the setup, you can run **Jaravis Agent** using Poetry and LangGraph:

1. **Run the Agent**
   ```bash
   poetry run langgraph dev

This command will start the LangGraph API server in development mode 
and launch the project in **LangGraph Studio**, 
where you can interact with the agents visually.
