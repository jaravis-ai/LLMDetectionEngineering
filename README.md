# LLM in Detection Engineering â€“ Jarvis Agent

## ðŸ”Ž Short Working Brief

**Jarvis Agent** is an AI-powered system designed to revolutionize **Detection Engineering** by automating the generation of high-quality detection rules across multiple cybersecurity platforms.

- **Ingestion**: Pulls and normalizes threat intelligence reports directly from **AlienVault OTX**.
- **Mapping**: Correlates ingested threat intelligence with **MITRE ATT&CK** techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs).
- **Rule Generation**: Automatically generates detection rules tailored for diverse cyber defense platforms (e.g., SIEMs, EDRs, IDS/IPS).
- **Repository Management**: Stores and organizes generated rules in a structured repository for rapid deployment and version control.

The goal is to **reduce manual detection engineering efforts by 80%**, enabling faster, more accurate, and consistent threat detection across enterprise security ecosystems.
